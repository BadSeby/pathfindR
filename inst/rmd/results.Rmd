pathfindR-Enrichment results are presented below:

## [All pathways that were found to be enriched](./all_pathways.html)
A table that lists all the pathways that were found to be enriched as well as lists of up- or down-regulated genes in a given pathway. The KEGG names are also linked to visualizations of these pathways with differentially-expressed genes colored according to log-fold-change values.

## [Table of genes with converted gene symbols](./genes_table.html)
A table listing the genes whose symbols (Old Symbol) were converted to aliases (Converted Symbol) that were present in the ppi.
