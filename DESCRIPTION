Description: Pathway enrichment analysis enables researchers to uncover mechanisms 
    underlying the phenotype. pathfindR is a tool for pathway enrichment analysis 
    utilizing active subnetworks. It identifies active subnetworks in a 
    protein-protein interaction network using user-provided a list of genes. 
    It performs pathway enrichment analyses on the identified subnetworks. 
    pathfindR also offers functionality to cluster enriched pathways and identify 
    representative pathways. The method is described in detail in 
    Ulgen E, Ozisik O, Sezerman OU. 2018. pathfindR: An R Package for Pathway 
    Enrichment Analysis Utilizing Active Subnetworks. bioRxiv. <doi:10.1101/272450>.
