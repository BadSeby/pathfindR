Title: Pathway Enrichment Analysis Utilizing Active Subnetworks
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Ege Ulgen, Ozan Ozisik
Maintainer: Ege Ulgen <egeulgen@gmail.com>
Description: Implementation of a work flow used for pathway enrichment
    utilizing active sub-networks. The input genes are mapped onto a 
    protein-protein interaction network and active sub-networks are 
    identified. These sub-networks are next used for pathway enrichment 
    analysis. Finally, the results are presented in an HTML report.
